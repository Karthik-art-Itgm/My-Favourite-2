        The first channel that he’d ever made was on August 3, 2011 called ‘CCunningham1423’ His current channel was originally under the name of 'Enjoy' and in the beginning stages of doing YouTube, he created list videos such as Top 5s, Top 10s, Top 100s, and Top 1000s, but slowly branched out into reaction-content which is why his YouTube profile name was changed from originally 'Enjoy' to 'Infinite Lists' and then to simply 'Infinite'. But water bottle flips were the videos that made him grow the most. His second channel was originally named 'Infinite Lists 2', and then More Infinte but was changed to 'Caylus'. He plays GTA 5 and ocassionally Minecraft on his second channel. He also has a channel that was his original channel where he did skateboarding tricks mostly which he renamed to Caylus Cunningham. Through all of his three channels he has roughly around 21.3 million subscribers and has around 4.2 billion views.
